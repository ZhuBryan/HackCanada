# Canopi

**Find your place — not just an apartment.**

Canopi is an AI-powered rental discovery platform that understands *who you are*, not just what you're searching for. Through lifestyle-revealing conversation, it learns your priorities and surfaces rentals across Canada that actually fit your life.

**Live demo:** https://hack-canada.vercel.app

## The Problem

Every rental platform in Canada filters by beds and price. They treat you like a set of constraints. Canopi starts with you — your habits, your energy, what a good day actually looks like — and works backwards to find where you belong.

---

## What it does

An AI assistant asks indirect, personality-driven questions — *"What does a good Sunday morning look like for you?"* — and infers your preferences across 8 lifestyle axes: walkability, nourishment, wellness, greenery, buzz, essentials, safety, and transit. As the conversation evolves, the map re-ranks listings in real time to match your actual life.

---

## Features

- **AI chat assistant** — Conversational matching that reads between the lines. Supports English and French. Voice input/output via ElevenLabs STT/TTS.
- **Interactive map** — Mapbox GL map showing 200+ real Canadian rentals with price pins, listing cards, and fly-to animations when the AI recommends a property.
- **8-axis preference radar** — Live spider chart that updates as Canopi learns what matters to you.
- **Neighborhood scores** — Amenity counts (schools, cafés, parks, groceries, transit, pharmacies, restaurants) within 1 km of every listing.
- **3D diorama view** — Three.js spatial visualization of neighborhood vitality around a selected listing.
- **Saved listings** — Bookmark favorites with Supabase-backed persistence across sessions.
- **Auth** — Email/password and Google OAuth via Supabase.

## How we built the data pipeline

Getting structured, enriched rental data at scale was one of our core technical challenges. We used a multi-stage AI-assisted pipeline:

1. **Scraping** — We pulled raw rental listings from RentFaster.ca, collecting addresses, prices, unit details, and geographic coordinates across Canadian cities.

2. **AI parsing & normalization** — Raw listing data is inconsistent: mixed formats, missing fields, non-standard descriptions. We used Gemini to parse and normalize listing text into a consistent schema — extracting bedroom counts, amenity mentions, building types, and income thresholds even when listings didn't follow any standard format.

3. **Geospatial enrichment** — For each listing, we queried the Overpass API (OpenStreetMap) to count nearby amenities within a 1 km radius: cafés, gyms, parks, grocery stores, pharmacies, schools, transit stops, and restaurants. This turned raw coordinates into neighborhood lifestyle scores.

4. **Caching** — Enriched data is cached locally (`data/geoapify-places-cache.json`) to avoid redundant API calls and keep the app fast.

The result: 200+ listings each carrying a rich neighborhood profile that the AI can reason about when making personalized recommendations.
